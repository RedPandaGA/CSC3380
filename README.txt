    With more people wanting to learn to cook more efficiently, product waste and learning new recipes
is typically the most difficult. Learning to cook with ingredients that are already bought can be
beneficial to individuals wanting to learn new recipes, like college students. In addition, it can
be accommodating for people who need to meal-prep for their busy week, maintain their diets, o
even get out of their comfort zones to make new and fun recipes. By creating a website to assist
beginner cooks, they are able to create a user profile, list the ingredients they already have
at home in an online pantry, and view various generated recipes based on those ingredients.
As a result, people can become more comfortable with making better home-cooked meals, enjoy
cooking as a hobby, and be less intimidated by the stress of finding new things to make.


    The technologies that will be incorporated to create the website and implementation design are
PostgreSQL, Express JS, React JS, Node JS, CSS, JSX, Material-UI, Amazon web services, PM2, NGINX,
git, and github. PostgreSQL used to store user data. ExpressJS is a backend web app framework used
for creating RESTful API endpoints. React is used as a frontend web app framework for creating user 
interfaces. NodeJS is used as a JS runtime environment. CSS is used as the style-sheet language that
allows for the styling of HTML and JSX components. JSX is used as a React extension to JS which
provides a way to structure components while also interacting with the DOM. Material-UI is
used as a React component library with a variety of built in React components. AWS EC2 Instance(VM)
contains our code base and can host our site. PM2 is the process manager that allows for our Express
server to recover from crashes and schedule tasks within Express. NGINX is the web server that
takes our production ready code base and serves it securely using HTTPS protocol. Git and GitHub 
used to organize and source control the project development, allowing for collaboration while
keeping a deployment ready product at hand.
