This is for working collaboratively on CSC3380. If you are unfamiliar with Git then be careful/ask before doing anything.

Please make branches when working/experimenting with code so your edits do not interfere with others until your changes are complete. 
Put a merge request when you're done to bring what you were working on into main.
